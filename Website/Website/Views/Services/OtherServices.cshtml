                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Selling tickets to a fund raising event is the single most important task in making the event a success.
                        The ticket price for the event can vary greatly, depending on the audience and what is included in the event (e.g. dinner, buffet, open bar, etc.)
                        Providing a discount for advance sales and block sales is a great incentive.
                        For example, if tickets at the door are normally $20 per person, you may want to offer pre-sale tickets at $15 per person or two for $25.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Sell sponsorships for each of the tables at your party. The price of sponsorship will vary based on the organization,
                        the size of the party, and the type of table being sponsored. Generally, the Roulette and Poker based tables yield a higher
                        price than a blackjack or the other tables. For example, Roulette and Poker based tables may cost $250 to sponsor and the Blackjack only $150.
                        You may want to give the sponsor of a table additional perks,
                        such as extra tickets to the event or additional “Fun Money” upon entry. Table sponsorship is a great source of revenue for your casino party.

                        In addition to the tables open for general use during the event, designate one or two Blackjack tables as “tournament” tables.
                        Players participating in tournament play contribute a donation (e.g. $10) and receive additional casino chips to be used only at that
                        tournament table for a specified period of time. At the end of the tournament the player with the most chips is declared the tournament winner.
                        There are many variations to tournament play at casino parties. Contact us and we will be happy to discuss them in more detail.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Upon arrival every guest receives a predetermined amount of “Fun Money.” However, selling additional
                        “Fun Money” during the event is a great way to generate additional proceeds for your fundraiser.
                        There is no standard price for purchasing additional “Fun Money”- we leave that to the organizer of the event.
                        Providing a discount for large purchases is a great incentive and will maximize the money that you bring in.
                        For instance, if a $5 donation entitles a guest to and additional 200 in “Fun Money”,
                        then a $10 donation would entitle a guest to 500 in “Fun Money” and a donation of $20 would get 1500 in “Fun Money”.
